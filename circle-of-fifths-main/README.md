Circle of Sound proposes the creation of interactive and exploratory digital tools to enhance understanding and engagement with the circle of fifths, a fundamental concept in music theory. Traditionally taught through static diagrams, the circle of fifths can be complex and intimidating for aspiring musicians, presenting a significant learning curve. We seek to transform this learning experience into an intuitive, engaging journey through an interactive visualization.

The interactive nature of these tools are designed to provide a hands-on learning experience. Users will not only visualize but also engage with the music theory concepts, making abstract ideas tangible and easier to comprehend. By incorporating audio feedback through Tone.js, learners can hear the impact of their interactions, further enriching the learning process. This project aims to democratize music theory education, making it more accessible and enjoyable for both novices and experienced musicians.
